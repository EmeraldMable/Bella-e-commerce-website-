## General info
What is it about? \
    This project is creating e-commerce website for Bella - local cosmetic brand of Myanmar. 

What kind of design did I choose for UI? \
    I choose simple and clean design for overall look and make it look modernized.

Why did I choose it? \
    While I was collecting ideas to build my personal project, I saw Bella official website by chance. On their offical website, I found UI unappealing and inconsistent. So I chose to build bella website as my frontend project but ended as a mern-stack website as I challenged myself along the way.

What did I gain from building this project? \
    I got improved in not only frontend but also backend, specifically, in react 90%, tailwind css 80% , mongodb 70% , express 65%, nodejs 50% , redux toolkit 50% and others such as jwt, firebase, authentication, cookie etc.

## Framework and library

It is created with \
Frontend - react (vite), tailwind css \
Backend - express , mongodb , redux toolkit
